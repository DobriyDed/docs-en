Support
========

If you were trying to answer a question and these docs don't provide you with one, worry not!

The best way to contact someone is via our `Discord server <https://discordapp.com/invite/kuDJG6e>`_. In there, you can either ask your question in the appropriate support channel or you can create a personal ticket with Tickety discord bot.


Tickety
--------

Create a new ticket::
    -new

This will create a private channel with you and support staff. 

If you have a general question, it's better to ask in the public channel as you'll likely get answered faster there.
