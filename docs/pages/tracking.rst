Player tracking
=======================

CSMM can take a snapshot of online players on your server every 30 seconds. It can store location and inventory data.

This information can be queried from the player tracking page on the website.

You can also consult the raw inventory or location data. If you specified a location to search in, distance will also be calculated.
