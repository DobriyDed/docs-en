How do I link my discord profile to CSMM?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to your profile page on CSMM, look for the Discord ID section and click the Discord icon to log in.

How do I add other people as admin on CSMM?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure the admin has logged in to CSMM at least once, to make sure he/she has a user profile. Next, go to your server settings -> Basic server settings -> add/remove admins.
Fill in the new admins steam ID there, CSMM will look to find a profile with corresponding steam ID.

Note that admins will have full control of your server on CSMM. Be careful who you give this permission to!
